## Project Status

### Checkers Game - Original Version

This is the original version of my Checkers project, which I developed during my studies. While it served as a valuable learning experience, I have identified several areas where the code can be improved. The primary issues with this version include:

- **Messy Code**: The codebase is not well-organized, making it difficult to read and understand.
- **Lack of OOP Principles**: The project does not adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, leading to less maintainable and extendable code.

### Motivation for Rewrite

To address these issues, I have decided to rewrite the entire project from scratch. The new version focuses on clean, clear code and follows OOP principles to create a more robust and maintainable Checkers game. You can find the improved version [here](https://github.com/RiadMhajne/Checkers2.git).

### Key Improvements in the New Version

- **Structured Class Design**: Introduction of well-defined classes for the board, pieces, game logic, and players.
- **Improved Code Readability**: The new codebase is organized with meaningful names and comments.
- **Enhanced Game Logic**: Refined gameplay mechanics for smoother and more enjoyable gameplay.

Thank you for checking out my project! For the latest and improved version, please refer to the new repository.
